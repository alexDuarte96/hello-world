# hello-world
Just to finish the first Github tutorial.
I'm Alejandro Duarte, an Information Technology Engineer 👨🏽‍💻 currently studying a Master's in Information Technology and Analytical Intelligence.

I have an enormous passion for technology 💻📱and started coding 5 years ago 📆, I Iove UI and UX design, typography and 2D animation. Learning about everything I can is what drives my daily life, also, I've given tutorship in Maths, Physics and Coding since Middle School to friends and colleagues.

My life long dream is to get to work as a Software Engineer at the Bay Area in California 🌉, which is what I'm planning to do just right after I finish my masters, so if we could try a practice interview once the course is over I would appreciate it a lot!
